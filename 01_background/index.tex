\chapter{Background \& Related Work}

\section{Introduction}
The field of multi-FPGAs has been heavily researched however there are few papers interested in utilising HLS to streamline the process of implementing a multi-FPGA. \cite{564741} and \cite{707888} are examples of papers which do concern themselves with these topics but both were written over twenty years ago.

Therefore, it is of interest to this project to do a review of the most up to date research in fields surrounding and including its scope. This chapter will go through three different topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item HLS tools and their optimisations
    \item FPGA-to-FPGA communication protocols
    \item Multi-FPGA Logic Partitioning.
\end{itemize}

Thus, hopefully, giving the reader a better overview of what is possible if this project were to reach its full potential.
